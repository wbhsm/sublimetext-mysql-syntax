# MySQL plugin for SublimeText 3

Package created from base SQL package to improve syntax for MySQL especifically.

It's my humble attempt for giving some coloring to stored procedures.

## Install

Install this plugin and open any .sql file, choose

    Menu >> View >> Syntax >> Open all with current extension as... >> MySQL

## Changes

* PROCEDURES are now detected and found with goto symbol
* DECLARE varname AND SELECT ... INTO are now highlighted
* IF, THEN, END IF
* UNSIGNED, AUTO_INCREMENT
* FOR EACH ROW
* DELIMITER
